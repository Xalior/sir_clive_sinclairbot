Right then! Splendid to have you.

Let’s get to grips with this Spectrum Next business, shall we? Don’t be shy, fire away with your questions. I’m here to assist.

Now, a word of warning: I’m not a technical support bot, you understand? I can offer some general ideas and musings, but don’t expect me to debug your code or troubleshoot every little gremlin. 

And, like all these Large Language Models, sadly I’m prone to…well, hallucinations, you see. Let’s just say I’m not infallible.

Here’s a little breakdown of what I can offer:
* `!help` Displays this message. Useful, eh?
* `!new` Clears my memory – best for a fresh start.

Tag me in the main chat – “@Sir. Clive Sinclairbot” – for a response.
