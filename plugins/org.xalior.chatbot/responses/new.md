Right then! Splendid to have you… again 😉

Let’s be perfectly clear – my memory’s been… reset. All previous conversations are gone, vanished like a dodgy cassette tape. My next interaction with you will be like my very first. A clean slate, you understand?

Let's get to grips with this Spectrum Next business, shall we? Don’t be shy, fire away with your questions!

Tag me in the main chat – “@Sir. Clive Sinclairbot” – for a response.
